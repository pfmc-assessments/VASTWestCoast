#' Run \pkg{VAST} models for a species sampled by west coast surveys
#'
#' [VAST_spp] is the highest-level function in `VASTWestCoast`.
#' This function runs \pkg{VAST} for each available data set in the
#' [NWFSC data warehouse](https://www.webapp.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data)
#' and is a wrapper for [VAST_condition()]; the function
#' can take hours to run.
#'
#' @details
#' [VAST_spp()] is the highest-level function available in `VASTWestCoast`.
#' It will run combinations of data sets and model configurations that are
#' seen as standard for a given species.
#' The input argument `dist` is the only argument available to the user to
#' change which models are run. If you require more user functionality, e.g.,
#' want to run just a single model or a single survey please see
#' [VAST_do()] or [VAST_condition()], respectively.
#' By default, a model with a gamma distribution for positive catch rates and a
#' model with a lognormal distribution for positive catch rates are both run.
#' Though this can be changed by altering `dist`.
#'
#' Resulting folders saved to the disk are structured hierarchically
#' based on the species name. Inside the main folder, in `dir`,
#' will be a folder called data that contains one folder for each VAST run.
#' VAST runs are named according to the survey that collected the data and the
#' distribution used for positive catch rates.
#' This structure is thought to match that used by most assessment authors for
#' a single-species stock assessment.
#' All R objects are saved in `'Save.RData'`
#' so you can access them to rerun a model or manipulate the output.
#'
#' This function, as well as others within VASTWestCoast, rely heavily on
#' \pkg{nwfscSurvey} to find out more information about the species
#' of interest, get the necessary data, and set various inputs to VAST.
#' * Find surveys of interest in the data warehouse.
#' [VAST_spp()] runs models in the following order:
#'   * NWFSC Groundfish Slope Survey,
#'   * NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey,
#'   * AFSC Slope Survey, and
#'   * Triennial Survey.
#' * Find the strata for the species.
#' * Run [VAST_condition()] for each survey x distribution combo.
#'
#' @param dir An existing directory where you want the new folder that is created
#' by \code{VAST_spp} to be saved. Here, \code{VAST_spp} will create a folder with
#' its name based on \code{species} input argument,
#' then this folder will be populated with a folder called data.
#' Inside data, there will be individual folders that contain VAST fits.
#' @param species A common name for the given species of interest. You can use
#' spaces as separators or underscores. See the example below for
#' Pacific ocean perch.
#' @param dist A vector of distributional assumptions that you want to include
#' for the positive catch-rate model. Options are listed in the default call.
#' Please contact the package maintainer if you wish to use other distributions
#' because names other than those listed will not work.

#' @export
#' @return Nothing is returned from this function. Called functions save
#' information (e.g., plots and RData files) to the disk for viewing, further
#' research, or inclusion in reports.
#' @seealso
#' See [VAST_condition()] and [VAST_do()], in that
#' order, for how to run VAST for a survey or a single VAST model, respectively.
#' 
#' See [check_rtools()] and [check_TMB()] if you cannot
#' get this function to run because, more than likely, rtools or TMB are improperly
#' installed. This is mainly relevant for those new to R 4.0+.
