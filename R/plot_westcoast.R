#' Plot the US West Coast
#'
#' Plot the US West Coast using data from
#' \code{\link[rnaturalearth]{ne_countries}}. The axes are in decimal degrees
#' and tick marks are labeled as such; thus, no labels are provided for the
#' axes themselves.
#'
#' @param g A ggplot object that you would like to add a map of the US West
#' Coast to.The coordinates of the object provided need to be in decimal
#' degrees such that the units of the added coastline will align with the
#' provided data. If a value is not supplied for this argument, then a
#' map of the US West Coast is returned, rather than adding to an object.
#' @param xlim A vector of two values supplying the limits to the x axis.
#' The default values focus the resulting map on the waters included in the
#' exclusive economic zone of the US. Units are in decimal degrees.
#' @param ylim A vector of two values supplying the limits to the y axis.
#' The default values focus the resulting map on the area between the Candian-
#' US and US-Mexico borders. Units are in decimal degrees.

#' @return A ggplot2 object providing a map of the US West Coast. The map is
