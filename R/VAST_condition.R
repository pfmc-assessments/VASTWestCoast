#' Estimate parameters by fitting VAST to empirical data
#'
#' Fits data loaded in your R session or data that is downloaded from the
#' Northwest Fisheries Science Center data warehouse
#' to a [VAST::make_model] using [TMBhelper::fit_tmb].
#' See the sections below for more details on how the model is configured.
#'
#' @section Pass:
#' The US West Coast has operated using two passes of the survey area, where
#' each pass is done during a different time of year. If you think that migration
#' happens temporally and this migration will affect spatial density, then you
#' should include pass as a covariate. The default is to ignore pass, but I
#' presume that many US West Coast users will want to change this using the
#' `settings` argument.
#'
#' @template conditiondir
#' @param settings A list of settings used to run the spatiotemporal model. The full
#' list of necessary settings can be seen by running [get_settings()], and
#' any settings that are not included in the list supplied to this argument
#' will be added at their default values.
#' @param spp A character value that includes the survey acronym and the species name
#' in latin with all words separated by an underscore.
#' For example, `"WCGBTS_Sebastes_crameri"`.
#' @template overdispersion
#' @param data A data frame that can be passed to the conditioning function
#' such that no data will be downloaded. todo: document the columns that are needed.
#' @param sensitivity logical; run sensitivity analyses specific to a given survey.
#' For example, the Triennial survey can be split into two separate surveys and limited
#' to 366 m depth.
#' @template compiledir
#'
#' @return Nothing is returned by the function, but the function saves `.RData`
#' files to the disk in `conditiondir`.
#' @author Kelli F. Johnson
#' @export
#' @seealso See [get_settings()] for a list of default settings. Anything not
#' included in your own list supplied to the settings argument will be taken from this
#' default list.
