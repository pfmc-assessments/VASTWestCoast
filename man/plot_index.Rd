plot_index(
  dir,
  recursive = TRUE,
  area = NULL,
  filter = NULL,
  keepyears = NULL,
  limit = NULL,
  legend_position = c(0.5, 0.05),

}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{A file path with folders containing VASTWestCoast runs.
Presumably each model run will be in its own folder, where these folder
names are later used to name the lines on the figure.}

\item{recursive}{A boolean value indicating whether or not you want to
recursively search for VASTWestCoast runs inside \code{dir} or just look
at the top level. The default is to look in all available folders.}

\item{area}{A vector of character values specifying the areas to plot.
The area is specified as the Fleet column in the csv file. The default is
to keep all of the defined areas and partition the results by the folder
it was found in and area using colors.
\code{NA} values in the Fleet column will be changed to \code{"unknown"}
and words separated using \code{"_"} will be separated using spaces, e.g.,
\code{"All_areas"} will become \code{"All areas"}. Only the first underscore
is replaced.}

\item{filter}{A character value used for regex matching of the file names.
The default is \code{NULL}, which leads to all files being used. Regular
expression matching can help you subset for a given distribution, e.g.,
\code{filter = "gamma"}, or for a specific survey, e.g., \code{"Triennial"}.
Note that folders can be separated with a forward or backwards slash depending
on other arguments, but it is best to try \code{"gamma/|lognormal/"} if you only
want files that are not sensitivity runs.}

\item{keepyears}{A vector of years you want to plot.
If \code{NULL}, which is the default, then all years are plotted.}

\item{limit}{A upper limit of the vertical axis, which is forced. The default is
to let the data define the upper limit, where all confidence intervals will
be included.}

\item{legend_position}{A vector of two numbers between zero and one that
specify the location of the legend relative to the lower-left corner.
The default values keeps the legend near the lower-left corner.}

\item{savefile}{The file name that you want the results saved to. A full path can
be specified, else the file will be saved in the current directory.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object that has been augmented to include the data used for
the plot. This data set is available using \code{[["dataforplot"]]} and was
created from sourced \code{Table_for_SS3.csv} files that were
subset appropriately based on the input arguments. The ggplot object is also
saved to the disk if \code{!is.null(savefile) == TRUE}.
}
\description{
Compare estimated indices and their confidence intervals on a single plot.
Results from \code{Table_for_SS3.csv} files are searched for and loaded as
objects, which are then plotted by model run and area
using unique colors for each run-area combination.
