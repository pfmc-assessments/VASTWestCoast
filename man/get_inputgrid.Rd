\title{Get the Input Grid for a Given Survey}
\usage{
get_inputgrid(survey, range.depth = c(-35, -Inf), range.lat = c(-Inf, Inf))
}
\arguments{
\item{survey}{A character value supplying the survey name.
The value is typically an acronym.
See \code{\link[nwfscSurvey]{createMatrix}()} for a list of defaults.}

\item{range.depth}{A vector of two numeric values specifying the range of
depth values of interest. Values must be in meters and negative values
represent those below sea level and positive values are assumed to be
above sea level. The first entry is the shallow value and the second
entry is the deeper cutoff. The default value is
\code{c(-35, -Inf)}, which truncates the data to depths deeper than 35 m
with no limit on how deep they can be.}

\item{range.lat}{A vector of two numeric values specifying the range of
latitude values of interest. Values must be in decimal degrees.
The first entry is the smaller value, i.e., southern border, and the second
entry is the larger value, i.e., northern border. The default value is
\code{c(-Inf, Inf)}, which leads to a range of the entire coast and if the
input argument is being used to truncate the data, the data is not changed.
To limit the data to California use \code{c(32.5, 42)} and
to limit the data to Washington and Oregon use \code{c(42, 49)}.
These ranges typically match up with the outer ranges of all
combined strata you wish to predict to, but
this does not have to be the case.}
}
\value{
A data frame of grid points with associated metadata for each
box. The data frame is an augmented version of the california current
data frame available in the \pkg{FishStatsUtils} package.
The most relevant columns will be those for Latitude (Lat),
Longitude (Lon), Depth (in meters), and Area_km2.
For Area_km2, a column created by this function,
only grid cells that pertain to the survey of interest will
have positive values. These grid cells with positive values will be
included in the prediction area for the results.
}
\description{
Define the input grid for a given survey, where positive values for
each coordinate pair define the area in square kilometers to predict to.
}
\details{
Grid cells within the cowcod conservation area
denoted by positive values in the \code{Cowcod} column and grid cells
with a depth less than 35 m are removed from the prediction area
for all surveys. The remaining grid cells are chosen for inclusion in
the predicted area based on the \code{"prop..."} column that is relevant
to the survey of interest. See \code{\link{convert_survey4vast}()} for
column names for a given survey.
